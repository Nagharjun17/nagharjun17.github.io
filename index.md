# Hi, I'm **Nagharjun Mathi Mariappan** 👋

**Data Scientist** focused on turning raw biomedical data into usable tools for clinicians. I design and deploy end to end machine learning systems from data pipelines and model training to containerised deployments on Docker and Kubernetes with CI/CD on local servers and cloud based. Comfortable moving across the stack: **Python and PyTorch for modelling, MLflow for experiment tracking, GitHub Actions for automation, and FastAPI for services**.

Lately I have been exploring GPU programming, ML compilers, and model optimizations on hardware. To support this, I set up a Proxmox-based home server on a Dell Precision T7910 with dual Xeons, 128 GB RAM, and an RTX 3060 where I experiment with CUDA kernels, Triton, Apache TVM, MLIR/LLVM passes and containerised deployments.

I enjoy collaborating with physicians and engineers to bring models into everyday workflows under various settings. Constantly learning, open sourcing when I can and motivated by interesting projects.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy playing soccer.
