* Deployed a fine tuned BERT for real time symptoms detection on Triton Inference Server with TensorRT GPU optimization on Docker, reducing latency from **387 ms to 71 ms** per clinical note across more than 9500.
* Implemented an LLM chat agent using Ollama and MCP Servers, enabling natural language querying of PostgreSQL and data folders.
* Architected a full-stack patient dashboard UI on a local Kubernetes cluster, integrating ML models, chatbots, and an exploratory data interface with CI/CD; 6 physicians use it daily, **cutting** chart lookup time by **65%**.
* Set up real-time Grafana dashboards inside a Linux container using Docker Compose, **monitoring** servers and infra via Prometheus and InfluxDB; gave **24 hours** visibility and cut troubleshooting time.
* Built a dual stream LSTM fusing airflow features, **boosting** 3 way breathe pattern detection F1 from **0.85** to **0.91**.
